Furthermore, single-use plastics will be banned, an on-site nursery will provide more than 25 million plants, and the entire destination will operate with zero waste to the landfill and zero carbon footprint. Visitation to The Red Sea destination will be capped at one million per year to ensure environmental enhancement targets are met, to push beyond conservation and explore innovative ways to regenerate the natural ecosystem. In addition to its commitment to the planet, The Red Sea destination is committed to its guests, offering unprecedented accessibility, not to mention world-class dining, adventure, and entertainment.
